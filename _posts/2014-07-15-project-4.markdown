description: This is a news app using Vice's (now deprecated) API. It was a group project, working with Git and Github to merge our branches together. I used the Job Scheduler, Broadcast Receiver, and Alarm Manager to create custom notifications to appear at the user's choice. I also worked on facebook sharing and did all the graphic design for this app. Check it out on github: https://github.com/joelimyx/project-3
