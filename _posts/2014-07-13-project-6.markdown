description: This was a project I built by myself for my Android Development Immersive course at General Assembaly. It's an app that allows you to record music to be locked at real-world locations you're at. It uses Google Maps API, Firebase Auth, Storage, Realtime Database, and GeoFire. Download it on the Google Play store!
